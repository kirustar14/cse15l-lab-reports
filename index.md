<br/>
Working directory when command was run: /home
<br/>
<br/>
The system shows no changes besides printing out another terminal line and we can see from the phrase [user@sahara ~] we are still in the same directory as before we ran that command. This is because cd is a command used to change directories and usually you give it a path to a directory to switch into but if we just write cd with no arguments or items following it, it should simply switch into the /home directory and since it was already in that directory to begin with there are no changes.

Working directory when command was run: /home
<br/>
<br/>

The system has changed directories into the /home/lecture1 directory from the /home directory. We can see this because in the output the terminal line now says [user@sahara ~/lecture1] which is diffrent than before because before there was no 'lecture1' and it was just [user@sahara ~]. Indiating that we have switched directories into /home/lecture1. In the filesystem we have a lecture1 file and so changing directories means that from the /home or initally overall setup we are now inside the lecture1 file which has the path /home/lecture1.
